    - The parser was rewritten to be much faster. Now it uses only one
      regexp in a split() instead of a whole bunch of regexps in a loop.
      Some other optimizations were also done.

    - Much better auto-correction of unescaped HTML brackets.
      The module now can autocorrect both opening and closing unmatched 
      HTML brackets.
    
    - Tagclasses were updated to include all relevant 
      elements from current XHTML DTD.

    - By default more harmless inline tags are allowed:
    
        B I A U STRONG BR
        EM CITE VAR ABBR Q DFN CODE SUB SUP SAMP KBD ACRONYM

    - The automatic HTML escaping was improved by
      godless@hermes.slipstream.com.
      Now the user can use HTML entities, but an ampersand that is not
      part of a HTML entity is still properly escaped.

    - Small fixes of some regexps.
      
    - Some documentation improvements.

    - A new, much better test suite.
